# mckenzies125-YOLO_Model_for_Bone_Fractures

The goal of this project was to train a neural network to solve a problem of our choosing. My group and I decided to train a YOLO model to classify the location of, if any, fractured bones in an x-ray. After uploading the data, generating our "y" values (a vector of information about the location of the fracture), and splitting the data into a train and test set, we trained our model. We used a hyperparameter finder and data augmentation to optimize the performance of the YOLO model. The project yielded a precision of 85% and a recall of 48%. YOLO11 was used, as well as the following Python libraries: torch, fastai, os, logging, pylabel, zipfile, shutil, ultralytics, ultralytics' YOLO, yaml, cv2, albumentations. This project was submitted as the final assignment for, "Introduction to Deep Learning." (DIDA-340)
